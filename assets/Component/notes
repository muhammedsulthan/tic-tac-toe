Importing React Hooks: The code imports the useState hook from React. This hook allows functional components to have state.
Initial Game Board: The initialGameBoard array represents the initial state of the Tic Tac Toe game board. Each element in the array represents a row, and each row is an array of three elements. Initially, all elements are null, indicating that no player has marked any square.
Functional Component GameBoard: This functional component GameBoard is defined. It initializes state using the useState hook. The gameBoard state variable holds the current state of the game board, and setGameBoard is the function to update this state.
handleSelectSquare Function: This function is responsible for updating the game board when a square is clicked. It takes rowIndex and colIndex as arguments, representing the row and column of the square clicked. It updates the game board by setting the clicked square to 'X'.
Rendering the Game Board: Inside the return statement, the component renders the game board using nested <ol> (ordered list) and <li> (list item) elements. It maps over each row of the game board and renders buttons for each square. Each button has an onClick event handler that triggers the handleSelectSquare function when clicked.
Button Content: The content of each button is determined by the value in the corresponding position of the gameBoard array. If the value is 'X', it means that the square has been clicked by the player 'X'. If the value is null, the square is empty.
Overall, this code sets up a basic Tic Tac Toe game board using React, allowing players to click on squares to mark them with 'X'.
